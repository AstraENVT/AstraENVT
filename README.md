- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstraENVT
- 👀 I’m interested in learning full-stack development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on The Odin Project, hoping to make nice websites!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, as I want to get down the fundamentals first!
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord! My handle is @astravt! Send me a message saying you met me on here, I'll be more than willing to have a chat!
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I stream on Twitch! Between learning code, streaming, and playing games with friends, I don't leave a lot of time for anything else! I'm learning how to balance it all over time!
